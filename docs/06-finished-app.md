# The Finished App

Open up the app in `05_all_together_now` and run it. 

Check to see if you can use different `.csv` files with it. 

## Extensions

1. Change the app to only use a few `fivethirtyeight` datasets, such as `biopics`, `bechdel` and `bad_drivers`. You'll have to change the file loader to a select box, and you may want to load the datasets up as a named list.
2. Try extending the boxplot to include tooltips using `plotly`. 
3. Add a summary view of the incoming data using `skimr`.
