```

# Setup

1) Make sure that you have the following packages installed:

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages(c("shiny", "tidyverse", "fivethirtyeight"))
```

2) Clone or download the tutorial from here (click the `Clone or Download` button, it's green and on the right side): https://github.com/laderast/shiny_workshop_pdxrlang 

3) Unzip, and open the `shiny_workshop_pdxrlang.Rproj` file in this folder. The project should open in RStudio and you should be ready!

4) (*optional*) If you want to use `plotly` in app 04B, you'll also need to do this. This part is a bit experimental, so it may or may not work.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
install.packages(c("devtools", "plotly"))
library(devtools)
#install latest version of ggplot2 (needed to use plotly)
install_github("hadley/ggplot2")
```

# Workshop Expectations

We want to foster a positive learning environment in this workshop. We expect everyone to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](http://github.com/laderast/shiny_workshop_pdxrlang/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). In short, be respectful of each other's learning styles, don't be dismissive or mean to someone who knows less than you, and try to help people if you see them struggle and you can help. We will enforce this and ask you to leave if you are not respectful to others. 

Additionally, please work together! The people in my workshops who have a really bad time and don't get anything out of it are the ones who try to do it alone. To quote Legend of Zelda, "*It's dangerous to go alone*". Talking through the material with someone will help you understand it.

We also are giving people post-it notes. Put them on your laptops so we can identify you if you need help or not. *Green* means "I'm okay, don't bug me", *Red* means "I need some help!".

# Introducing Shiny

Welcome to Shiny! Shiny is a framework in R for making interactive visualizations for the web created by Joe Cheng. Nearly any plot in R can be made into an interactive visualization by adding some simple interface elements and mapping these interface elements into the plot. It's an extremely powerful technique for visualization and communication of findings.

Before we get started, we need to talk a little bit about the architecture of `shiny` apps. `shiny` apps are *server-based*, which means that all of the calculations and plot rendering happen on a server (when you're running them in RStudio, your server is your computer). Compare this to JavaScript visualization frameworks such as `D3.js`, where the client's computer needs to do all of the computing of the visualization. 

There are a lot of benefits to server-based frameworks, namely that your users don't need to have a heavy-duty computer to visit your site, and that your data is sitting behind a protected server. One of the difficulties is that it can be difficult to scale for lots of users.

## The concept of `ui` and `server` elements

Every shiny app has two elements. The first is `ui`, which handles both the user controls and the layout and placement of output elements, such as plots or tables. `ui` usually consists of a layout scheme, with user controls (such as sliders, select boxes, radio boxes, etc) specified here. The second element is `server`, which handles all of the calculations and the generation of plots for `ui`. 

`ui` and `server` are only connected by two objects `input`, and `output` (they actually are environments, but we'll just say they are objects). `ui` puts the values from the controls into `input`, which can be accessed by `server`. For example, if we have a slider called `year_release` in `ui`, we can access the value of that slider in `server` through `input$year_release`. 

`server` will then do something with the slider value and generate some output. Where does it put the output? If you guessed `output`, then give yourself a star! `ui` then takes `output` and will then display it using the various _Output functions (such as `plotOutput`, `textOutput` and`tableOutput`).

If this is confusing, go very carefully through the diagram below. I'm happy to answer any questions you have about it.

![*Basic shiny architecture*](img/shiny-architecture.png)

# App 1: Connecting `ui` and `server`

We'll be taking two simple `ggplot2` graphs and turning them into part of an interactive dashboard. The data we're going to use is the `biopics` dataset from the `fivethirtyeight` package. 

## Making two plots interactive

The first visualization is a scatterplot visualizing the total `box_office` by `year_release`, colored by `type_of_subject`. For the interactive portion, we're going to color each point by different categories. Notice we use `aes_string()` to map columns to aesthetics. This is important, since we'll be passing `character` arguments to modify this plot later.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(biopics)

biopics %>% ggplot(aes_string(y="box_office", x="year_release", color = "type_of_subject")) +
        geom_point()
```

The second visualization is going to be a boxplot of `box_office` by category:

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
biopics %>% ggplot(aes_string(x="type_of_subject", y="box_office", 
                                   fill="type_of_subject")) +
  geom_boxplot() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45))
```

## Exercise

1. Open the `01_app_basics` folder and open the `app.R` file. This is the file for the Shiny App and we'll modify it.

2. Look at the structure of the code. There are two objects that we define: `ui` and `server`. We make them into an app with the command `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)`.

3. Take a look at the `server` code. Notice where our `ggplot2` code is. Both graphs are placed in a `renderPlot()` function, and we give them a place in `output`, so `ui` can "see" it. The scatterplot is named `output$scatter_plot` and the boxplot is named `output$boxoffice_boxplot`. 

4. Take a look at the `ui` code. Where in the code are we displaying `scatter_plot` and `boxoffice_boxplot`? Notice we don't need to refer to `output`. The display function `plotOutput` knows to look in the `output` object.

5. Run the code by clicking the "Run App" button on the top of code window. You can see that we output our graphs in the "main" window.

6. Let's paste in a control. Paste the following code where it says "Add User Interface Element here" in `app.R`. If you run the app again, you should see a control, but it doesn't change the plot.

```
selectInput("color_opts", "Select Category to Color With",
        choices = select_color_options)
```

7. Let's connect the control to the plot. Change the `color` aesthetic to the following:

```
color = input$color_opts
```

8. Now try running the app. Your select box should control what categorical data controls the color of the points. Try it out!

9. Bonus! Let's add in another category option. Where should you add it? Just in case, here are the column names and their data types. You probably shouldn't add `title`, `director`, `subject`, `lead_actor_actress` since they aren't really categories, and they will blow up your `ggplot`s.

```{r}
glimpse(biopics)
```

## What you've learned so far

+   The architecture of shiny apps
+   How `ui` and `server` communicate through `output` and `input`
+   How `ui` displays plots (using `plotOutput`)
+   Adding a control (a `selectInput`)
+   Connecting that control to our `plots` using `input`

## For More Info

# App 2: Reactives

So we've connected our control up. Great! Now let's add a numeric filter to our data by using an `reactive`. `reactive`s are the heart and soul of `shiny`. We'll use a `reactive` to filter our data, and pass this filtered data on to our two plots. This means we can dynamically filter our data and our plots will update. 

A `reactive` can be thought of a bit of code that runs whenever the controls that map to it are changed. In this case, our `reactive` represents our filtered dataset when we adjust our slider.

![*Basic workflow of reactives*](img/reactive.png)

## Exercise

1. Open up the `02_reactives` folder and the `app.R` file within.

2. Try running the app. You can see that we added a slider (using `sliderInput`) in `ui`, but it doesn't do anything. We're going to connect that slider to filter the `biopics` dataset. 

3. You might notice that there is a new object in the `server` code, called `biopics_filtered`. This is where we're going to connect our slider.

4. Paste the following bit of code into the reactive, after `biopics`. What does it do?

```
%>% filter(year_release > input$year_filter)
```
5. Notice how we call the reactive in `output$scatter_plot`? We have to use `biopics_filtered()` rather than `biopics_filtered`. A reactive is actually a function, and so you need to use the function notation to invoke it in a `renderPlot` statement.

6. Ok, run the app again and adjust the slider. Notice how the top plot is changing but the bottom one isn't. Why isn't it running?

7. Modify the code in `output$boxoffice_boxplot` to use the `biopics_filtered()` reactive. Where should you put it? Run the code again to make sure it works.

## For More Info

We've only shown one type of `reactive`, basically a `reactive` `data.frame`. Almost any type of object can be a `reactive`. Here are more resources on learning about them.

+   [Reactivity 101 (Dean Attali)](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/#10-reactivity-101) - Dean Attali's pages on Shiny are a good read, especially his section on reactives.
+   [Reactivity: An Overview (Official Shiny Documentation)](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/reactivity-overview.html) - I personally find this overview of `reactive`s a little confusing.

# App 3: Adding in a file loader: `observe` and `update`.

We're going to make our file explorer more useful for other files by not hard coding variable names. We'll take a `.csv` file as input, and populate our `selectInput`s with categories that are related to our selected variables.

![*observe/update programming pattern*](img/observe_update.png)

## Exercise

This will be more code review than activity. I apologize. Go through it and you will learn a lot.

1. Open the `app.R` in `03_observe_update`.

2. Try running the following code. What is in `categoricalVars` and what is in `numericVars`? Is it what you expected? If you're confused, please let me know.

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
#since we're in the shiny_pdx_rlang directory,
#we need to set our working directory to 03_observe_update

library(fivethirtyeight)
library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)

##Load in the helper functions
source("03/_observe_update/helper.R")
data(biopics)
myDataFrame <- biopics

##these functions return the categorical variables and
##the numeric variables, given a data.frame
##They're in helper.R
##Try running all the code before ui
##and look at what categoricalVars and numericVars contains
categoricalVars <- get_category_variables(myDataFrame)
numericVars <- get_numeric_variables(myDataFrame)

glimpse(myDataFrame)
categoricalVars
numericVars
```

3. Try running the app, and try loading the `datasetB.csv` file using the file browser (it should be in `03_observe_update`). Did the `x_variable` and `y_variable` `selectInputs` change?

4. Let's add a `selectInput` to filter on a particular category within our category variable. Uncomment all of the areas that say `uncomment this code for step 4` (there are 4 sections). As you do, follow the path from the `myData()` `reactive` to the `observe` code block to the `selectInput`s in `ui.R`

5. What is going on? Let's start with the `fileInput` in `ui.R`. Where does `input$file1` appear? What do we do with it in the reactive?

6. Now let's look at the `observe` codeblock. Is it dependent on a reactive? Where are we calling the `reactive`? What are we doing in the codeblock?

7. What does the `updateSelectInput` code do? What are we passing into it? What `selectInputs` are we modifying?

8. Try running the app again and make sure that it works before moving on.

# App 4A: Adding tooltips

Tooltips are great for examining single datapoints in the data. We're going to add tooltips to our scatterplot so that users can hover over a datapoint and see all the information.

There are a couple of web programming techniques we need to understand before we can understand how tooltips work. 

In terms of interactivity, `shiny` has the following interactions built into `renderPlot()`: `hover` (where in the graph the mouse is hovering), `click` (grabs the location where you clicked), and `brush` (select multiple points). We'll play around with `hover` and `click`.

Both the `hover` and `click` arguments will return the same thing: basically an object (we'll call it a `hover` object for now) which has the x-y coordinate information about the mouse position. That gets us part of the way there. The other part is returning the row in our data that's the closest to that point on the graph. `nearPoints` handles getting the row from the `data.frame`, which we'll refer to as a `point`. We use both this `hover` and `point` object to build our tooltip.  

Once we have the row, we pass this on to a helper function called `return_tooltip`, which returns the location where we want the tooltip as well as the content of the tooltip. Then we display it onto our plot using `wellPanel`.

## Exercise

1. Try running the `app.R` in `04A_tooltips`. Mouse near a data point. Did you get a tooltip?
2. Try changing the `hover` argument in `plotOutput` to `click`. That is, instead of

```
 plotOutput("scatter_plot", hover = "plot_hover"),
```
make it

```
plotOutput("scatter_plot", click = "plot_hover"),
```
What did that do with our interactivity?

3. Uncomment the `print` statement in the `renderUI` codeblock. Try mousing over a point. Where is it printing the output? (hint: not the webpage.) How does this help us?

4. If you're really interested in how it works, try printing `hover` as well.

# App 4B: Adding tooltips with `plotly`

There is another way to add tooltips: use the `plotly` library. This is a JavaScript (built on top of `d3.js`) library that makes your `ggplots` more interactive, with built in tooltips. 

The `plotly` library itself relies on `d3.js`, which is a client-side visualization library. So if you add `plotly`, does this make your shiny app client-based? Not quite. All of the controls and data serving are still done *server-side*. It's only the last bit that is translated to JavaScript and is *client-side*.

Please note that we're not putting anything on the `plotly` servers when we do this. All of the data still lives on your server.

## Exercise

1. Try running the `app.R` in `04B_tooltips_plotly`. Mouse over a datapoint. Neat, huh?

2. How did we supply the infomation to the tooltip? Take a look at the `aes_string()` code. Notice we're passing in a bunch of dummy variables into `aes_string`. Do these variables appear in the tooltip?

```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
aes_string(Movie="title", y="box_office", x="year_release", 
                                       color=input$color_variable, director="director",
                                       subject="subject", actor_actress="lead_actor_actress",
                                       gender="subject_sex", subject_race="subject_race"))
```

The `plotly` package can instantly make your graphs more interactive using the `ggplotly()` function. For more info and some recipes, go here: https://plot.ly/ggplot2/ 

# Where Next?

The wide world of `shiny` is now yours for the taking. I'm compiling a list of resources that I found really useful below.

## Programming Resources

* [The Shiny Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) - Tons of examples about how to implement things in Shiny. Please note that the examples can be a little too terse. 
* [Dean Attali's Site](https://deanattali.com/blog/advanced-shiny-tips/) - his "Advanced Shiny Tips" page has a really useful FAQ. This is usually where I start when I have a question.
* [Advanced Shiny (Dean Attali)](https://github.com/daattali/advanced-shiny) - This is the repo for all of Dean's shiny tips.
* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) - with the `plotly` package, you can translate ggplots into client-side `d3.js` plots, which can be customized with a lot more interactivity, and it runs on top of `shiny`. I'm still learning how to use it, but you can make your interactive graphics very slick with it.

* [shinyjs](https://deanattali.com/shinyjs/) - Add more JavaScript components to your shiny app.

## Deploying your app

You may notice that we've run everything on our own machines. What if we want to share our apps? We'll need to deploy them to a web accessible server. There are two main places you can deploy your Shiny apps. 

https://shinyapps.io is a more streamlined service, and it lets you push apps to it using the `rsconnect` package. For more info, go here: http://docs.rstudio.com/shinyapps.io/. The free account gives you 5 free apps and something like 25 hours of access time for free.

if you need more service, Rstudio's new `RStudio Connect` service: https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/. `Rstudio Connect` is more of a complete solution, giving you a web-accessible `Rstudio` server instance along with a `shiny` server instance. It costs money.

You can also install [Shiny Server on something like a DigitalOcean Droplet](https://deanattali.com/2015/05/09/setup-rstudio-shiny-server-digital-ocean/), or a [web-accessible server](https://www.rstudio.com/products/shiny/download-server/). Note that if you are non-academic, or need things like user authentication, you'll need to pay for a license.

## Debugging your app

Debugging is probably one of the most difficult things about an interactive app. You can see certain errors in your console, but they aren't usually very helpful because these errors aren't localized to a line number.

Instead, you'll have to use things like `print` statements and `breakpoints` to debug your app. More info here: https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/debugging.html

Don't forget there is a vibrant Shiny user community that you can ask for help! https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/help.html

## Shiny related things that I've done

Here are some examples of things I've done with Shiny.

* [Surrogate Mutation](https://tladeras.shinyapps.io/surrogateShiny/). I put this together for my dissertation paper to explain network effects of cancer mutations in cell lines.
* [An Introduction to Categorical Data](https://minnier.shinyapps.io/ODSI_categoricalData/). This is a `learnr` tutorial that uses `shiny` to teach basic statistical concepts that Jessica Minnier and I put together for the [OHSU Data Science Institute](https://ohsulibrary-datascienceinstitute.github.io) workshop.
* [flowDashboard example](https://tladeras.shinyapps.io/sampleFlowDashboard/) - Just tooting my own horn here. This is package that I'm working on for interactive exploration of flow cytometry data.

## I want more!

Look into the world of `htmlwidgets`: http://www.htmlwidgets.org. Basically, people are trying to bring more visualization frameworks (such as `d3.js`) to R. Someone may have a `htmlwidget` that could work for you.
