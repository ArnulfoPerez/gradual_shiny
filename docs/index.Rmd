```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Setup

1) Make sure that you have the following packages installed:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("shiny", "tidyverse", "fivethirtyeight"))
```

2) Clone or download the tutorial from here (click the `Clone or Download` button, it's green and on the right side): https://github.com/laderast/shiny_workshop_pdxrlang 

3) Unzip, and open the `shiny_workshop_pdxrlang.Rproj` file. The project should open in RStudio and you should be ready!

## Introducing Shiny

Welcome to Shiny! Shiny is a framework in R for making interactive visualizations for the web created by Joe Cheng. Nearly any plot in R can be made into an interactive visualization by adding some simple interface elements and mapping these interface elements into the plot. It's an extremely powerful technique for visualization and communication of findings.

Before we get started, we need to talk a little bit about the architecture of `shiny` apps. `shiny` apps are *server-based*, which means that all of the calculations happen on a server (when you're running them in RStudio, your server is your computer). Compare this to JavaScript visualization frameworks such as `D3.js`, where the client's computer needs to do all of the computing of the visualization. 

There are a lot of benefits to server-based frameworks, namely that your users don't need to have a heavy-duty computer to visit your site, and that your data is sitting behind a protected server. One of the difficulties is that it can be difficult to scale for lots of users.

### The concept of `ui` and `server` elements

Every shiny app has two elements. The first is `ui`, which handles both the user controls and the layout and placement of output elements, such as plots or tables. `ui` usually consists of a layout scheme, with user controls (such as sliders, select boxes, radio boxes, etc) specified here. The second element is `server`, which handles all of the calculations and the generation of plots for `ui`. 

`ui` and `server` are only connected by two objects `input`, and `output` (they actually are environments, but we'll just say they are objects). `ui` puts the values from the controls into `input`, which can be accessed by `server`. For example, if we have a slider called `year_release` in `ui`, we can access the value of that slider in `server` through `input$year_release`. 

`server` will then do something with the slider value and generate some output. Where does it put the output? If you guessed `output`, then give yourself a star! `ui` then takes `output` and will then display it using the various _Output functions (such as `plotOutput`, `textOutput` and`tableOutput`).

If this is confusing, go very carefully through the diagram below. I'm happy to answer any questions you have about it.

## App 1: Connecting `ui` and `server`

We'll be taking two simple `ggplot2` graphs and turning them into part of an interactive dashboard. The data we're going to use is the `biopics` dataset from the `fivethirtyeight` package. 

### Making two plots interactive

The first visualization is going to be visualizing the total `box_office` by `year_release`, colored by `type_of_subject`. For the interactive portion, we're going to color each point by different categories. Notice we use `aes_string()` to map columns to aesthetics. This is important, since we'll be passing `character` arguments to modify this plot later.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(biopics)

biopics %>% ggplot(aes_string(y="box_office", x="year_release", color = "type_of_subject")) +
        geom_point()
```

The second visualization is going to be a boxplot of `box_office` by category:

```{r warning=FALSE}
biopics %>% ggplot(aes_string(x="type_of_subject", y="box_office", 
                                   fill="type_of_subject")) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

1. Open the `01_app_basics` folder and open the `app.R` file. This is the file for the Shiny App and we'll modify it.

2. Look at the structure of the code. There are two objects that we define: `ui` and `server`. We make them into an app with the command `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)`.

3. Take a look at the `server` code. Notice where our `ggplot2` code is. Both graphs are placed in a `renderPlot()` function, and we give them a place in `output`, so `ui` can "see" it. The scatterplot is named `output$scatter_plot` and the boxplot is named `output$boxoffice_boxplot`. 

4. Take a look at the `ui` code. Where in the code are we displaying `scatter_plot` and `boxoffice_boxplot`? Notice we don't need to refer to `output`. The display function `plotOutput` knows to look in the `output` object.

5. Run the code by clicking the "Run App" button on the top of code window. You can see that we output our graphs in the "main" window.

6. Let's paste in a control. If you run the app again, you should see a control, but it doesn't change the plot.

```
selectInput("color_opts", "Select Category to Color With",
        choices = select_color_options)
```

7. Let's connect the control to the plot. 

8. Bonus! Let's add in another category option. Where should you add it? Just in case, here are the column names and their data types. 

```{r}
glimpse(biopics)
```

## App 2: Reactives

So we've connected our control up. Great! Now let's add a numeric filter to our data by using an `reactive`. `reactive`s are the heart and soul of `shiny`. We'll use a `reactive` to filter our data, and pass this filtered data on to our two plots. This means we can dynamically filter our data and our plots will update.

1. Open up the `02_reactives` folder. 

## App 3: Adding tooltips

Tooltips are great for examining single datapoints in the data. 

## App 4: Adding in a file loader: `observe` and `update`.

## Where Next?

The wide world of `shiny` is now yours for the taking. I'm compiling a list of resources that I found really useful:

* The Shiny Gallery
* Dean Attali's Site and Repo

### I want more interactivity

Look into the world of `htmlwidgets`
