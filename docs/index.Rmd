```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Setup

1) Make sure that you have the following packages installed:

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("shiny", "tidyverse", "fivethirtyeight"))
```

2) Clone or download the tutorial from here (click the `Clone or Download` button, it's green and on the right side): https://github.com/laderast/shiny_workshop_pdxrlang 

3) Unzip, and open the `shiny_workshop_pdxrlang.Rproj` file. The project should open in RStudio and you should be ready!

## Introducing Shiny

Welcome to Shiny! Shiny is a framework in R for making interactive visualizations for the web created by Joe Cheng. Nearly any plot in R can be made into an interactive visualization by adding some simple interface elements and mapping these interface elements into the plot. It's an extremely powerful technique for visualization and communication of findings.

Before we get started, we need to talk a little bit about the architecture of `shiny` apps. `shiny` apps are *server-based*, which means that all of the calculations happen on a server (when you're running them in RStudio, your server is your computer). Compare this to JavaScript visualization frameworks such as `D3.js`, where the client's computer needs to do all of the computing of the visualization. 

There are a lot of benefits to server-based frameworks, namely that your users don't need to have a heavy-duty computer to visit your site, and that your data is sitting behind a protected server. One of the difficulties is that it can be difficult to scale for lots of users.

### The concept of `ui` and `server` elements

Every shiny app has two elements. The first is `ui`, which handles both the user controls and the layout and placement of output elements, such as plots or tables. `ui` usually consists of a layout scheme, with user controls (such as sliders, select boxes, radio boxes, etc) specified here. The second element is `server`, which handles all of the calculations and the generation of plots for `ui`. 

`ui` and `server` are only connected by two objects `input`, and `output` (they actually are environments, but we'll just say they are objects). `ui` puts the values from the controls into `input`, which can be accessed by `server`. For example, if we have a slider called `year_release` in `ui`, we can access the value of that slider in `server` through `input$year_release`. 

`server` will then do something with the slider value and generate some output. Where does it put the output? If you guessed `output`, then give yourself a star! `ui` then takes `output` and will then display it using the various _Output functions (such as `plotOutput`, `textOutput` and`tableOutput`).

If this is confusing, go very carefully through the diagram below. I'm happy to answer any questions you have about it.

## App 1: Connecting `ui` and `server`

We'll be taking two simple `ggplot2` graphs and turning them into part of an interactive dashboard. The data we're going to use is the `biopics` dataset from the `fivethirtyeight` package. 

### Making two plots interactive

The first visualization is a scatterplot visualizing the total `box_office` by `year_release`, colored by `type_of_subject`. For the interactive portion, we're going to color each point by different categories. Notice we use `aes_string()` to map columns to aesthetics. This is important, since we'll be passing `character` arguments to modify this plot later.

```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(fivethirtyeight)
data(biopics)

biopics %>% ggplot(aes_string(y="box_office", x="year_release", color = "type_of_subject")) +
        geom_point()
```

The second visualization is going to be a boxplot of `box_office` by category:

```{r warning=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
biopics %>% ggplot(aes_string(x="type_of_subject", y="box_office", 
                                   fill="type_of_subject")) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

1. Open the `01_app_basics` folder and open the `app.R` file. This is the file for the Shiny App and we'll modify it.

2. Look at the structure of the code. There are two objects that we define: `ui` and `server`. We make them into an app with the command `shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)`.

3. Take a look at the `server` code. Notice where our `ggplot2` code is. Both graphs are placed in a `renderPlot()` function, and we give them a place in `output`, so `ui` can "see" it. The scatterplot is named `output$scatter_plot` and the boxplot is named `output$boxoffice_boxplot`. 

4. Take a look at the `ui` code. Where in the code are we displaying `scatter_plot` and `boxoffice_boxplot`? Notice we don't need to refer to `output`. The display function `plotOutput` knows to look in the `output` object.

5. Run the code by clicking the "Run App" button on the top of code window. You can see that we output our graphs in the "main" window.

6. Let's paste in a control. Paste the following code where it says "Add User Interface Element here" in `app.R`. If you run the app again, you should see a control, but it doesn't change the plot.

```
selectInput("color_opts", "Select Category to Color With",
        choices = select_color_options)
```

7. Let's connect the control to the plot. Change the `color` aesthetic to the following:

```
color = input$color_opts
```

8. Now try running the app. Your select box should control what categorical data controls the color of the points. Try it out!

9. Bonus! Let's add in another category option. Where should you add it? Just in case, here are the column names and their data types. 

```{r}
glimpse(biopics)
```

### What you've learned so far

+   The architecture of shiny apps
+   How `ui` and `server` communicate through `output` and `input`
+   How `ui` displays plots (using `plotOutput`)
+   Adding a control (a `selectInput`)
+   Connecting that control to our `plots` using `input`

### For More Info

## App 2: Reactives

So we've connected our control up. Great! Now let's add a numeric filter to our data by using an `reactive`. `reactive`s are the heart and soul of `shiny`. We'll use a `reactive` to filter our data, and pass this filtered data on to our two plots. This means we can dynamically filter our data and our plots will update. 

A `reactive` can be thought of a bit of code that runs whenever the controls that map to it are changed. In this case, our `reactive` represents our filtered dataset when we adjust our slider.

1. Open up the `02_reactives` folder and the `app.R` file within.

2. Try running the app. You can see that we added a slider (using `sliderInput`) in `ui`, but it doesn't do anything. We're going to connect that slider to filter the `biopics` dataset. 

3. You might notice that there is a new object in the `server` code, called `biopics_filtered`. This is where we're going to connect our slider.

4. Paste the following bit of code into the reactive, after `biopics`. What does it do?

```
%>% filter(year_release > input$year_filter)
```
5. Notice how we call the reactive in `output$scatter_plot`? We have to use `biopics_filtered()` rather than `biopics_filtered`. A reactive is actually a function, and so you need to use the function notation to invoke it in a `renderPlot` statement.

6. Ok, run the app again and adjust the slider. Notice how the top plot is changing but the bottom one isn't. Why isn't it running?

7. Modify the code in `output$boxoffice_boxplot` to use the `biopics_filtered()` reactive. Where should you put it? Run the code again to make sure it works.

### For More Info

We've only shown one type of `reactive`, basically a `reactive` `data.frame`. Almost any type of object can be a `reactive`. Here are more resources on learning about them.

+   [Reactivity 101 (Dean Attali)](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/#10-reactivity-101) - Dean Attali's pages on Shiny are a good read, especially his section on reactives.
+   [Reactivity: An Overview (Official Shiny Documentation)](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/reactivity-overview.html) - I personally find this overview of `reactive`s a little confusing.

## App 3: Adding in a file loader: `observe` and `update`.

We're going to make our file explorer more useful for other files by not hard coding variable names. We'll take a `.csv` file as input, and populate our `selectInput`s with categories that are related to our selected variables.

1. Open the `app.R` in `04_observe_update`.

2. Run the code before 

3. Let's add a `selectInput` to filter on a particular category within our category variable. We'll need to create a new `reactive` to hold the categories for each category variable.


## App 3: Adding tooltips

Tooltips are great for examining single datapoints in the data. We're going to add tooltips to our scatterplot so that users can click on it.

### For More Info

The `plotly` package also does tooltips, and can instantly make your graphs more interactive. `plotly` moves a lot of the graphing and such to the client side using JavaScript. You can see an example in `03_tooltips_plotly`. 


## Where Next?

The wide world of `shiny` is now yours for the taking. I'm compiling a list of resources that I found really useful:

* [The Shiny Gallery](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) - Tons of examples about how to implement things in Shiny
* [Dean Attali's Site](https://deanattali.com/blog/advanced-shiny-tips/) - his "Advanced Shiny Tips" page has a really useful FAQ.
* [Advanced Shiny (Dean Attali)](https://github.com/daattali/advanced-shiny) - This is the repo for all of Dean's shiny tips.
* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/r/) - with the `plotly` package, you can translate ggplots into client-side `d3.js` plots, which can be customized with a lot more interactivity, and it runs on top of `shiny`. I'm still learning how to use it, but you can make your interactive graphics very slick with it. 

## Shiny related things that I've done

* [`ggvis` Intro](http://laderast.github.io/ggvis-intro/) - before `plotly`, there was `ggvis` for adding more interactivity, such as tooltips. These are some old slides about `ggvis` that I made. I don't use it anymore because the syntax is very different than `ggplot2` and it's really still very beta.
* [flowDashboard example](https://tladeras.shinyapps.io/sampleFlowDashboard/) - Just tooting my own horn here. This is package that I'm working on for interactive exploration of flow cytometry data.

### I want more interactivity

Look into the world of `htmlwidgets`
